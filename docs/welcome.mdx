**Prefab is a Python DSL for building interactive UIs that compile to React.** You describe your interface as a tree of Python components, and Prefab turns it into JSON that a React renderer compiles into a live, interactive application — forms, tables, cards, dialogs, and real-time state management, all without leaving Python.

```python
from prefab_ui import UIResponse, Column, Heading, Text
from prefab_ui.components import Card, CardContent, Input, Button, Row
from prefab_ui.actions import ToolCall

def search_dashboard(query: str = "") -> UIResponse:
    with Column() as view:
        Heading("Search")
        with Row():
            Input(name="query", placeholder="Search...")
            Button(
                "Go",
                on_click=ToolCall(
                    name="search",
                    arguments={"q": "{{ query }}"},
                    result_key="results",
                ),
            )
        with Card():
            with CardContent():
                Text("{{ results.length }} results found")

    return UIResponse(
        state={"query": query, "results": []},
        view=view,
    )
```

Prefab is made with 💙 by [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/).

## Why Prefab

MCP server authors shouldn't have to leave Python to give users a real interface. Rich UIs typically mean a separate frontend stack — a bundler, a component framework, a whole ecosystem of dependencies that has nothing to do with the server logic you're writing. Prefab eliminates that gap. You describe your UI in Python, and it compiles to React.

Prefab originated as [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)'s Apps system and has been extracted as a standalone library so it can serve any backend. The Python side has no transport dependencies — it works with MCP servers via FastMCP, with REST APIs via FastAPI, or with anything else that can return JSON.

## How It Works

The core idea is a pipeline: **Python components → JSON → React**.

1. You build a component tree using Prefab's Python DSL — 35+ components covering layout, forms, data display, and interactive elements
2. The tree serializes to a JSON wire format via `UIResponse.to_json()`
3. A React renderer (shipped as `@prefect/prefab-ui` on npm) compiles the JSON into a live interface

State flows through templates. When you write `{{ query }}`, the renderer interpolates the current value of `query` from client-side state. Actions like `ToolCall` and `SetState` update that state, keeping the UI reactive without you writing any JavaScript.

## Installation

```bash
pip install prefab-ui
```

Requires Python 3.10+. The only runtime dependency is Pydantic.
