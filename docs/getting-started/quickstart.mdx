import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

## Install

```bash
pip install prefab-ui
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

## Create an app

Save this as `app.py`:

```python app.py
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Button, Card, CardContent, CardFooter, Column, H3, Input, Muted
from prefab_ui.actions import ShowToast

with Column(css_class="max-w-md mx-auto") as view:
    with Card():
        with CardContent():
            with Column(gap=3):
                name_input = Input(name="name", placeholder="Your name...")
                H3(f"Hello, {name_input.rx}!")
                Muted("Type your name and watch the heading update in real time.")
        with CardFooter():
            Button("Say hi", on_click=ShowToast(f"Hey there, {name_input.rx}!"))

app = PrefabApp(view=view, state={"name": "world"})
```

## Run it

```bash
prefab serve app.py --reload
```

Your browser opens to `http://127.0.0.1:5175`. The `--reload` flag watches your file for changes — every time you save `app.py`, the UI regenerates automatically. Here's what you'll see:

<ComponentPreview json={{"view":{"type":"Column","cssClass":"max-w-md mx-auto","children":[{"type":"Card","children":[{"type":"CardContent","children":[{"cssClass":"gap-3","type":"Column","children":[{"content":"Hello, {{ name }}!","type":"H3"},{"content":"Type your name and watch the heading update in real time.","type":"Muted"},{"type":"Input","inputType":"text","placeholder":"Your name...","name":"name","disabled":false,"required":false}]}]},{"type":"CardFooter","children":[{"type":"Button","label":"Say hi","variant":"default","size":"default","disabled":false,"onClick":{"action":"showToast","message":"Hey there, {{ name }}!"}}]}]}]},"state":{"name":"world"}}} />

Type in the input — the heading updates instantly. Click the button — toast notification. That's reactive state, event handling, and a production component library, all from a dozen lines of Python.

Try editing `app.py` while the server is running. Change the heading text, swap the button variant to `"destructive"`, or add another `Input` — save the file and the browser updates immediately. This is the development loop: write Python, save, see it live.

## What just happened

Prefab components nest using Python's `with` statement — `Card`, `Column`, `Input` compose into a tree that compiles to JSON, which a bundled React renderer turns into real HTML. The [Composition](/getting-started/composition) page walks through this in detail.

Every form control syncs its value to a client-side state key. The `.rx` property returns a reactive reference — `name_input.rx` in an f-string becomes `{{ name }}` in the protocol, and any component containing it re-renders whenever the input changes. No server round-trip needed. Read more about [reactive expressions](/expressions/overview).

`ShowToast` is a client-side [action](/actions/overview) — it runs entirely in the browser. Prefab has several of these (`SetState`, `ToggleState`, `OpenLink`), plus server actions like `CallTool` for when you need a backend.
