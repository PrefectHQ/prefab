import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

`If`, `Elif`, and `Else` let you conditionally render different components based on expression results. They mirror Python's own `if/elif/else` syntax and read the same way — no wrappers, no extra indentation.

## Basic Usage

The simplest case: show something only when a condition is true.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"State","state":{"inventory":0},"children":[{"type":"Condition","cases":[{"when":"inventory == 0","children":[{"type":"Alert","variant":"destructive","children":[{"type":"AlertTitle","content":"Out of stock"}]}]}]}]}}`}>
<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Alert, AlertTitle, If, State

with State(inventory=0):
    with If("inventory == 0"):
        with Alert(variant="destructive"):
            AlertTitle("Out of stock")
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "type": "State",
    "state": {
      "inventory": 0
    },
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "Condition",
        "cases": [
          {
            "when": "inventory == 0",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "Alert",
                "variant": "destructive",
                "children": [
                  {
                    "type": "AlertTitle",
                    "content": "Out of stock"
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

A lone `If` renders its children when the condition is truthy, and renders nothing when it's falsy.

## If / Else

Add an `Else` branch to render fallback content when the condition is false.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"State","state":{"showDetails":true},"children":[{"cssClass":"gap-2","type":"Column","children":[{"type":"Condition","cases":[{"when":"showDetails","children":[{"type":"Card","children":[{"type":"CardHeader","children":[{"type":"CardTitle","content":"Project Details"}]},{"type":"CardContent","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"Heart of Gold \\u2014 Infinite Improbability Drive"}]}]}]}],"else":[{"type":"Badge","label":"Details hidden","variant":"secondary"}]}]}]}}`}>

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## If / Elif / Else

Chain multiple conditions with `Elif`. The renderer evaluates them in order and renders the first match. If nothing matches, the `Else` branch renders.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"State","state":{"inventory":5},"children":[{"type":"Condition","cases":[{"when":"inventory == 0","children":[{"type":"Badge","label":"Out of stock","variant":"destructive"}]},{"when":"inventory < 10","children":[{"type":"Badge","label":"Low stock \\u2014 {{ inventory }} left","variant":"secondary"}]}],"else":[{"type":"Badge","label":"In stock","variant":"default"}]}]}}`}>
<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Badge, Elif, Else, If, State

with State(inventory=5):
    with If("inventory == 0"):
        Badge("Out of stock", variant="destructive")
    with Elif("inventory < 10"):
        Badge("Low stock — {{ inventory }} left", variant="secondary")
    with Else():
        Badge("In stock")
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "type": "State",
    "state": {
      "inventory": 5
    },
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "Condition",
        "cases": [
          {
            "when": "inventory == 0",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "Badge",
                "label": "Out of stock",
                "variant": "destructive"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "when": "inventory < 10",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "Badge",
                "label": "Low stock \u2014 {{ inventory }} left",
                "variant": "secondary"
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        "else": [
          {
            "type": "Badge",
            "label": "In stock",
            "variant": "default"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

Try changing `inventory` to `0` or `50` to see the different branches render.

## Chain Rules

Consecutive `If/Elif/Else` siblings in the same parent form a single conditional chain:

- A chain starts with `If` and extends through consecutive `Elif` and `Else` siblings
- `Elif` and `Else` are optional — a lone `If` is valid
- `Else` must be last in a chain
- Any non-conditional sibling breaks the chain

```python
with Column():
    # Chain 1: If / Elif / Else
    with If("status == 'error'"):
        Badge("Error", variant="destructive")
    with Elif("status == 'warning'"):
        Badge("Warning", variant="secondary")
    with Else():
        Badge("OK")

    Text("---")  # breaks the chain

    # Chain 2: independent If
    with If("showDetails"):
        Text("Details here...")
```

This produces two independent `Condition` nodes with a `Text` between them.

## Wire Format

In the Python DSL, you write natural `If/Elif/Else` siblings. During serialization, these are grouped into a single `Condition` node on the wire. The `If` and `Elif` components never appear in the JSON directly — they're purely authoring constructs.

Each `Elif` becomes a `case` entry with a `when` expression. The `Else` branch becomes the `else` field. See the [Condition protocol reference](/protocol/condition) for the full schema.

## API Reference

<Card icon="code" title="If">
<ParamField body="condition" type="str" required>
  Expression to evaluate. Renders children when truthy. Can be passed as a positional argument.
</ParamField>
</Card>

<Card icon="code" title="Elif">
<ParamField body="condition" type="str" required>
  Expression to evaluate. Must follow an `If` or another `Elif`. Can be passed as a positional argument.
</ParamField>
</Card>

<Card icon="code" title="Else">
  Renders children when no preceding `If` or `Elif` matched. Takes no condition argument.
</Card>
