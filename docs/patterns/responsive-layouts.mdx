There are two ways to make a grid adapt to screen size: **auto-fill** reflows based on available space, **responsive breakpoints** jump at fixed viewport widths. They solve different problems, and picking the right one avoids a lot of CSS fiddling.

## Auto-fill

`min_column_width` tells the grid the narrowest a column should be. Columns appear and disappear as the container widens or shrinks — no breakpoints involved.

```python
Grid(min_column_width="16rem", gap=4)
```

This is the more flexible option. It adapts to whatever space is available, so it works in sidebars, dialogs, and variable-width panels without any breakpoint tuning.

## Responsive Breakpoints

`Responsive` on the `columns` or `gap` prop sets explicit values at each viewport width. The column count jumps at fixed breakpoints regardless of the container.

```python
from prefab_ui.components import Grid, Row
from prefab_ui.css import Responsive

Grid(columns=Responsive(default=1, md=2, lg=3))
Row(gap=Responsive(default=2, md=4, lg=6))
```

`Responsive` maps breakpoint keys to values. The `default` key sets the base, and `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl` override it progressively. Use this for full-page layouts where you control the overall structure and want precise control over each breakpoint.

| Prop | Components | Compiles to |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `columns` | [Grid](/components/grid) | `grid-cols-{n}` |
| `gap` | [Grid](/components/grid), [Row](/components/row), [Column](/components/column) | `gap-{n}` |

## Which One?

When in doubt, start with `min_column_width`. It handles the most common case — "fill the space with reasonably-sized columns" — without thinking about specific screen widths. Reach for `Responsive` when you need the column count to be exact at each breakpoint.
