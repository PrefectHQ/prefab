**Prefab is a JSON component format that renders to real interactive frontends.** Describe a UI — from an MCP server, a ChatGPT app, an AI agent, or a Python script — and Prefab renders it as a live React application with forms, tables, state management, and real-time interactivity.

<Tip>
Every example in the Prefab docs — including this one! — is rendered with Prefab from the Python code.
</Tip>

Prefab is made with 💙 by [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/).

## Why Prefab

Every frontend framework assumes a human wrote the code and a server is running. Prefab assumes neither. It's a JSON component format that anything can target: an MCP server, a ChatGPT app, an AI agent mid-conversation, or a Python developer who doesn't want to touch JavaScript.

The renderer compiles that JSON to real React — production UI components with state management, forms, data tables, and declarative interactivity. And it runs as a self-contained static bundle, no backend required at runtime.

Prefab originated as [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)'s Apps system and has been extracted as a standalone library so it can serve any backend. The Python side has no transport dependencies — it works with MCP servers via FastMCP, with REST APIs via FastAPI, or with anything else that can return JSON.

## How It Works

The core idea is a pipeline: **JSON → React**. For Python authors, it's **Python → JSON → React**.

1. A component tree is described — in Python via the DSL, or as raw JSON from any source
2. The tree serializes to Prefab's JSON wire format
3. A React renderer (shipped as `@prefecthq/prefab-ui` on npm) compiles the JSON into a live interface

State flows through templates. When you write `{{ query }}`, the renderer interpolates the current value of `query` from client-side state. Actions like `ToolCall` and `SetState` update that state, keeping the UI reactive.

## Installation

```bash
pip install prefab-ui
```

Requires Python 3.10+. The only runtime dependency is Pydantic.
