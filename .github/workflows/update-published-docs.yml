# Points the `published-docs` branch at the tagged commit on each release.
#
# Mintlify builds docs from `published-docs`, so this keeps published docs in
# sync with what's actually released. The renderer CDN (`@latest`) updates at
# the same time via publish-renderer.yml.
#
# Uses force-push (not fast-forward) so that cherry-picks to published-docs
# between releases don't block the next update.
