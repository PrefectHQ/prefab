import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

Prefab renders to Tailwind CSS, so Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) work directly in any `css_class`:

```python
from prefab_ui.components import Button

Button("Submit", css_class="w-full md:w-auto")
```

Prefab also provides a `Responsive` helper that makes breakpoint logic more structured — especially when you're toggling multiple classes or want to keep things readable.

## The Responsive Helper

`Responsive` maps breakpoint keys to values. The `default` key sets the base, and `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl` override it progressively as the viewport widens. It's accepted anywhere `css_class` is — on any component.

```python
from prefab_ui.components import Button, Responsive

# Full-width on mobile, auto-width from md up
Button("Submit", css_class=Responsive(default="w-full", md="w-auto"))
```

Under the hood, this compiles to the same Tailwind classes you'd write by hand: `w-full md:w-auto`. The advantage shows up when breakpoint values get more complex:

```python
from prefab_ui.components import Card, Responsive

Card(css_class=Responsive(
    default="p-3 text-sm",
    md="p-6 text-base",
    lg="p-8 text-lg shadow-lg",
))
# → p-3 text-sm md:p-6 md:text-base lg:p-8 lg:text-lg lg:shadow-lg
```

Each breakpoint value is a full string of classes. `Responsive` prefixes every class in that string with the breakpoint — you don't have to repeat the prefix yourself.

## Responsive Layout Props

Beyond `css_class`, a few layout props accept `Responsive` directly so you don't have to think in raw class names:

| Prop | Components | Compiles to |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `columns` | [Grid](/components/grid) | `grid-cols-{n}` |
| `gap` | [Grid](/components/grid), [Row](/components/row), [Column](/components/column) | `gap-{n}` |

```python
from prefab_ui.components import Grid, Row, Responsive

# Stacks on mobile, 2 columns on tablets, 3 on desktop
Grid(columns=Responsive(default=1, md=2, lg=3))

# Tighter gap on small screens
Row(gap=Responsive(default=2, md=4, lg=6))
```

## Auto-fill vs. Responsive

There are two ways to make a grid adapt. They solve different problems:

**Auto-fill** (`min_column_width`) reflows based on the **container's** actual width. Columns appear and disappear as space allows. Use this when the grid lives inside a variable-width panel, sidebar, or dialog.

```python
Grid(min_column_width="16rem", gap=4)
```

**Responsive** (`columns` with breakpoints) reflows based on the **viewport** width. The column count jumps at fixed breakpoints regardless of the container. Use this for full-page layouts where you control the overall structure.

```python
Grid(columns=Responsive(default=1, md=2, lg=3))
```

When in doubt, start with `min_column_width` — it's the more flexible option since it adapts to whatever space is available.

## Breakpoints

| Key       | Min Width | Typical Device    |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `default` | —         | All screens       |
| `sm`      | 640px     | Large phones      |
| `md`      | 768px     | Tablets           |
| `lg`      | 1024px    | Laptops           |
| `xl`      | 1280px    | Desktops          |
| `2xl`     | 1536px    | Large monitors    |

These match [Tailwind's default breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design). Each breakpoint applies from that width *and up* — `md` means "768px and wider", not "exactly 768px".
