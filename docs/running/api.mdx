<Info>
The API server integration is under active development. This page will be updated with full documentation when it ships.
</Info>

Prefab apps can be backed by a REST API for server-side data, persistence, and business logic. The integration targets FastAPI as the primary backend, with conventions for routing, tool calls, and serving the renderer.

The core idea: your Prefab UI defines the frontend, and your API routes handle the backend. Client-side actions like `SetState`, `ToggleState`, and `ShowToast` work immediately, and server actions like `CallTool` map to your API endpoints — so your UI can fetch data, submit forms, and trigger backend logic with a round-trip to your server.

```python
# Coming soon — this is the target API
from fastapi import FastAPI
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Card, CardContent, Column, H3, Text

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def dashboard():
    with Card() as view:
        with CardContent():
            with Column(gap=3):
                H3("Dashboard")
                Text("Backed by a real server.")
    return PrefabApp(view=view).html()
```
