import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

## Install

```bash
pip install prefab-ui
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

## Create an app

Save this as `app.py`:

```python app.py
from prefab_ui.app import PrefabApp
from prefab_ui.components import Button, Card, CardContent, CardFooter, Column, H3, Input, Muted
from prefab_ui.actions import ShowToast

with Column(css_class="max-w-md mx-auto") as view:
    with Card():
        with CardContent():
            with Column(gap=3):
                name_input = Input(name="name", placeholder="Your name...")
                H3(f"Hello, {name_input.rx}!")
                Muted("Type your name and watch the heading update in real time.")
        with CardFooter():
            Button("Say hi", on_click=ShowToast(f"Hey there, {name_input.rx}!"))

app = PrefabApp(view=view, state={"name": "world"})
```

## Run it

```bash
prefab serve app.py
```

Your browser opens to `http://127.0.0.1:5175`. Here's what you'll see:

<ComponentPreview json={{"view":{"type":"Column","cssClass":"max-w-md mx-auto","children":[{"type":"Card","children":[{"type":"CardContent","children":[{"cssClass":"gap-3","type":"Column","children":[{"content":"Hello, {{ name }}!","type":"H3"},{"content":"Type your name and watch the heading update in real time.","type":"Muted"},{"type":"Input","inputType":"text","placeholder":"Your name...","name":"name","disabled":false,"required":false}]}]},{"type":"CardFooter","children":[{"type":"Button","label":"Say hi","variant":"default","size":"default","disabled":false,"onClick":{"action":"showToast","message":"Hey there, {{ name }}!"}}]}]}]},"state":{"name":"world"}}} />

Type in the input — the heading updates instantly. Click the button — toast notification. That's reactive state, event handling, and a production component library, all from a dozen lines of Python.

Pass `--reload` to regenerate on save while you iterate:

```bash
prefab serve app.py --reload
```

## What just happened

Three things worth understanding:

**Component trees.** Prefab components nest using Python's `with` statement. `Card`, `Column`, `Input` — they compose into a tree that compiles to JSON, which a bundled React renderer turns into real HTML.

**Client-side state.** Every form control syncs its value to a state key. The `.rx` property returns a reactive reference to that key — `name_input.rx` in an f-string becomes `{{ name }}` in the protocol, and any component containing it re-renders whenever the input changes. No server round-trip needed. You seed initial values with `PrefabApp(state={"name": "world"})`.

**Actions.** `ShowToast` is a client-side action — it runs entirely in the browser. Prefab has several of these (`SetState`, `ToggleState`, `OpenLink`), plus server actions like `CallTool` for when you need a backend.

## Where to go from here

**Explore components.** Browse all 35+ components in the [Playground](/playground), or dive into the [component reference](/components/button).

**Add client interactivity.** The `.rx` property generates reactive references to component state. The underlying `{{ }}` expression language supports [operators, conditionals, and pipes](/expressions/overview) — enough to build surprisingly rich UIs without a server.

**Wire up a backend.** When you need server logic, Prefab works with [API servers](/running/api) and [FastMCP](/running/fastmcp). Server actions like `CallTool` let your UI make round-trips for real data.

**Add expressions.** [Templates, operators, and pipes](/expressions/overview) let you build reactive UIs. Use `.rx` for Python-authored references, or write `{{ }}` directly when working with runtime variables.
