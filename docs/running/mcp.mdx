<Info>
MCP App support will be available in [FastMCP 3.1](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp). This page will be updated with full documentation when it ships.

MCP Apps are an extension of the Model Context Protocol that lets MCP servers render interactive UIs directly inside the conversation. Your tool returns a component tree, and the host displays it as a live interface — forms, charts, data tables — not as static text.

The integration targets FastMCP. Mark any tool with `app=True` and return a Prefab component tree:

```python
from prefab_ui import FastMCP
from prefab_ui.components import Card, CardContent, Column, H3, Input, Button
from prefab_ui.actions import ToolCall

mcp = FastMCP("My Server")

@mcp.tool(app=True)
async def search(query: str = "") -> Card:
    results = find_items(query) if query else []
    with Card() as view:
        with CardContent():
            with Column(gap=3):
                Input(name="q", placeholder="Search...")
                Button("Go", on_click=ToolCall("search", arguments={"query": "{{ q }}"}))
    return view
```

When a host like Claude Desktop or Prefect Horizon calls this tool, the user sees a fully interactive search UI instead of plain text. Client-side actions like `SetState`, `ToggleState`, and `ShowToast` work immediately in the browser, while server actions like `ToolCall` make a round-trip through the MCP protocol back to your server — so the UI can fetch fresh data, submit input, and trigger server-side logic.
