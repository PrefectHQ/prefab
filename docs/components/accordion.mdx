## Default Open

Use `default_open_items` to expand items when the accordion first renders. Pass an index or title.

</ComponentPreview>

You can also assign a stable `value` to items and reference them by name, which is useful when item order might change:

```python {1, 2}
with Accordion(default_open_items="faq"):
    with AccordionItem("FAQ", value="faq"):
        Text("Frequently asked questions...")
    with AccordionItem("Contact"):
        Text("Get in touch...")
```

## Multiple Open

Set `multiple=True` to allow more than one section open at a time.
