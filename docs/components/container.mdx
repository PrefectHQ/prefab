import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

Container centers content with a responsive max-width and horizontal padding that scales with the viewport.

## Basic Usage

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"Container","children":[{"content":"The Hitchhiker's Guide","type":"H1"},{"content":"A wholly remarkable book, the standard repository for all the knowledge and wisdom in the Galaxy.","type":"P"}]}}`}>
<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import (
    Container,
    H1,
    P,
)

with Container():
    H1("The Hitchhiker's Guide")
    P(
        "A wholly remarkable book, the standard"
        " repository for all the knowledge and"
        " wisdom in the Galaxy."
    )
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "type": "Container",
    "children": [
      {
        "content": "The Hitchhiker's Guide",
        "type": "H1"
      },
      {
        "content": "A wholly remarkable book, the standard repository for all the knowledge and wisdom in the Galaxy.",
        "type": "P"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

## Narrowing with css_class

Override the default max-width for narrower content areas like forms or prose.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"cssClass":"max-w-2xl","type":"Container","children":[{"content":"The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.","type":"P"}]}}`}>
<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Container, P

with Container(css_class="max-w-2xl"):
    P(
        "The ships hung in the sky in much the"
        " same way that bricks don't."
    )
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "cssClass": "max-w-2xl",
    "type": "Container",
    "children": [
      {
        "content": "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.",
        "type": "P"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>
