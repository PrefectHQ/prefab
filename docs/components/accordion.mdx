import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

Accordions let users expand and collapse sections to reveal content progressively. Each `AccordionItem` has a clickable title and hidden content that appears on expand.

## Basic Usage

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"Accordion","multiple":false,"collapsible":true,"children":[{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is the Answer?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"Forty-two. The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is the Heart of Gold?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A starship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive. It can pass through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is Deep Thought?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A supercomputer designed to find the Answer to the Ultimate Question. It took 7.5 million years to compute: 42."}]}]}}`}>

            "Question of Life, the Universe, and "

## Default Open

Use `default_open_items` to expand items when the accordion first renders. Pass an index or title.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"Accordion","multiple":false,"collapsible":true,"defaultValues":["What is the Answer?"],"children":[{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is the Answer?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"Forty-two. The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is the Heart of Gold?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A starship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive. It can pass through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is Deep Thought?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A supercomputer designed to find the Answer to the Ultimate Question. It took 7.5 million years to compute: 42."}]}]}}`}>

```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Accordion, AccordionItem, Text

with Accordion(default_open_items=0):
    with AccordionItem("What is the Answer?"):
        Text(
            "Forty-two. The Answer to the Ultimate "
            "Question of Life, the Universe, and "
            "Everything."
        )
    with AccordionItem("What is the Heart of Gold?"):
        Text(
            "A starship powered by the Infinite "
            "Improbability Drive. It can pass through "
            "every conceivable point in every "
            "conceivable universe almost simultaneously."
        )
    with AccordionItem("What is Deep Thought?"):
        Text(
            "A supercomputer designed to find the "
            "Answer to the Ultimate Question. It took "
            "7.5 million years to compute: 42."
        )
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "type": "Accordion",
    "multiple": false,
    "collapsible": true,
    "defaultValues": [
      "What is the Answer?"
    ],
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "AccordionItem",
        "title": "What is the Answer?",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "Text",
            "content": "Forty-two. The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "AccordionItem",
        "title": "What is the Heart of Gold?",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "Text",
            "content": "A starship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive. It can pass through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "AccordionItem",
        "title": "What is Deep Thought?",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "Text",
            "content": "A supercomputer designed to find the Answer to the Ultimate Question. It took 7.5 million years to compute: 42."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

You can also assign a stable `value` to items and reference them by name, which is useful when item order might change:

```python {1, 2}
with Accordion(default_open_items="faq"):
    with AccordionItem("FAQ", value="faq"):
        Text("Frequently asked questions...")
    with AccordionItem("Contact"):
        Text("Get in touch...")
```

## Multiple Open

Set `multiple=True` to allow more than one section open at a time.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"type":"Accordion","multiple":true,"collapsible":true,"defaultValues":["Who is Arthur Dent?","Who is Ford Prefect?"],"children":[{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"Who is Arthur Dent?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"An ordinary human from Earth, unexpectedly swept into the cosmos when his planet is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"Who is Ford Prefect?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A researcher for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and Arthur's best friend. He's from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse."}]},{"type":"AccordionItem","title":"What is the Guide?","children":[{"type":"Text","content":"A digital reference with the words 'Don't Panic' written in large, friendly letters on the cover."}]}]}}`}>
