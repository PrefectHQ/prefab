import { ComponentPreview } from '/snippets/component-preview.mdx'

Most components in a Prefab layout are defined up front — you know at build time that there's a heading here, a table there. But sometimes a region of your UI needs to be filled in later, maybe by an action that fetches content or by state that arrives after the initial render. `Slot` reserves a named place in your layout for that dynamic content.

`Slot` watches a state key. When that key holds a component tree (a JSON object with a `type` field), Slot renders it. When the key is empty, Slot renders its children as fallback content — or nothing at all.

## Basic Usage

Pass the state key name as the first argument. Here, `info` holds a Card component tree in state:

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"cssClass":"gap-4","type":"Column","children":[{"type":"Heading","content":"Starship Registry","level":3},{"type":"Slot","name":"info"}]},"state":{"info":{"type":"Card","children":[{"type":"CardHeader","children":[{"type":"CardTitle","content":"Heart of Gold"},{"type":"CardDescription","content":"Infinite Improbability Drive equipped"}]}]}}}`}>

```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading, Slot

set_initial_state(
    info={
        "type": "Card",
        "children": [
            {
                "type": "CardHeader",
                "children": [
                    {"type": "CardTitle", "content": "Heart of Gold"},
                    {
                        "type": "CardDescription",
                        "content": "Infinite Improbability Drive equipped",
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
    }
)

with Column(gap=4):
    Heading("Starship Registry", level=3)
    Slot("info")
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "cssClass": "gap-4",
    "type": "Column",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "Heading",
        "content": "Starship Registry",
        "level": 3
      },
      {
        "type": "Slot",
        "name": "info"
      }
    ]
  },
  "state": {
    "info": {
      "type": "Card",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "CardHeader",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "CardTitle",
              "content": "Heart of Gold"
            },
            {
              "type": "CardDescription",
              "content": "Infinite Improbability Drive equipped"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

The layout defines *where* the dynamic content goes. The state (or an action that populates it) determines *what* appears there. In practice, the state key is often populated by a `ToolCall` or `API` action with `result_key` — the action fetches a component tree and writes it into state, and the Slot picks it up automatically.

## Fallback Content

Nest children inside `Slot` to define what shows when the state key is empty. This is useful for slots that start empty and get populated by a user action.

<ComponentPreview auto json={`{"view":{"cssClass":"gap-4","type":"Column","children":[{"type":"Heading","content":"Item Detail","level":3},{"type":"Slot","name":"selected_item","children":[{"cssClass":"text-muted-foreground py-8 text-center","type":"Text","content":"Select an item from the list to view details"}]}]}}`}>
<CodeGroup>
```python Python icon="python"
from prefab_ui.components import Column, Heading, Slot, Text

set_initial_state()

with Column(gap=4):
    Heading("Item Detail", level=3)
    with Slot("selected_item"):
        Text(
            "Select an item from the list to view details",
            css_class="text-muted-foreground py-8 text-center",
        )
```
```json Protocol icon="brackets-curly"
{
  "view": {
    "cssClass": "gap-4",
    "type": "Column",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "Heading",
        "content": "Item Detail",
        "level": 3
      },
      {
        "type": "Slot",
        "name": "selected_item",
        "children": [
          {
            "cssClass": "text-muted-foreground py-8 text-center",
            "type": "Text",
            "content": "Select an item from the list to view details"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</ComponentPreview>

Since the fallback is a regular component tree, you can make it as rich as you need — icons, buttons, styled containers. Once `state["selected_item"]` gets a component tree, the fallback disappears and the slot content takes over.
